    {
        "title": "Basic Prompt Structure and Key Parts",
        "content": "Prompts are made up of several key components that work together to guide the AI. While not every prompt will contain all these elements, understanding how each part functions can help you create more targeted and effective inputs.The key parts of a prompt are:The DirectiveExamplesRole (Persona)Output FormattingAdditional Information"
    },
    {
        "title": "The Directive",
        "content": "The Directive is the main instruction in the prompt. It tells the AI exactly what task it should perform. Without a clear directive, the AI may provide a generic or irrelevant response. A directive is a concise instruction or question that gives the AI a clear task to perform. It can range from a request to generate text, solve a problem, or format information in a specific way."
    },
    {
        "title": "Examples",
        "content": "When the task is more complex, providing Examples can help guide the AI in producing more accurate responses. This technique is especially useful in few-shot and one-shot prompting, where a model is given one or more examples of what you expect in the output. Examples demonstrate the expected format, style, or structure of the output. By including them in the prompt, you can guide the AI's behavior and help it better understand the desired result."
    },
    {
        "title": "Role (Persona)",
        "content": "Assigning a Role to the AI, also known as a persona, helps frame the response in a specific way. By telling the AI to act as an expert, a professional, or a specific character, you can guide the tone, style, and content of the response. The role element in a prompt assigns a specific persona or perspective to the AI, encouraging it to tailor its response according to the designated role."
    },
    {
        "title": "Output Formatting",
        "content": "Output Formatting ensures that the response follows a particular structure—whether it's a list, a table, or a paragraph. Specifying the format can help prevent misunderstandings and reduce the need for additional post-processing. Without clear formatting instructions, the AI may provide a response that is technically correct but not in the desired format. Specifying the structure makes the output easier to use."

        "title": "What is Instruction Prompting?",
        "content": "Instruction prompting centers around the ability of generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), to follow natural language instructions. It aims to allow models to work with new, previously unseen tasks by understanding and executing instructions expressed in natural language, without requiring task-specific training data."
    },
    {
        "title": "Why Instruction Prompting is Important",
        "content": "Generative AI models rely on well-crafted instructions to understand tasks and deliver accurate results. Instruction prompting enables users to guide AI through complex tasks—like text formatting, PII removal, and essay evaluation—without needing vast labeled datasets or pre-programmed rules. This method is flexible and scalable, making it particularly useful for adapting AI to new tasks."

    {
        "title": "Start with Clear and Specific Prompts",
        "content": "Effective prompts are clear and specific. Vague prompts lead to vague answers, so directness is crucial. For example, instead of 'Write something about climate change,' use 'Write a 100-word summary of the impact of climate change on coastal cities, focusing on rising sea levels.' Best practices include using plain language, avoiding ambiguity, and stating exactly what you want."

    {
        "title": "Add Context for Better Results",
        "content": "Providing context helps AI models generate more accurate and relevant responses. For example, 'Write a product description' is less effective than 'Write a 50-word product description for wireless earbuds, focusing on sound quality and comfort for athletes.' Combining instructions with context is especially useful for tasks like summarization."
    },
    {
        "title": "Iteration and Refinement",
        "content": "Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Start with a simple prompt and refine it based on the AI's response. For example, 'Summarize this book' can be refined to 'Summarize the book's key themes in 2-3 sentences, focusing on the author's viewpoint on personal growth.' Layering instructions can further improve outputs."

        "title": "What Are Delimiters and Why Use Them?",
        "content": "Delimiters act like separators in prompts, similar to organizing data into separate Excel sheets. Without delimiters, the AI may struggle to process information, leading to irrelevant or incorrect outputs. Using delimiters makes prompts clearer, improves response accuracy, and helps the AI differentiate between instructions, examples, and other information."
    },
    {
        "title": "How to Use Delimiters in Prompts",
        "content": "For simple prompts, triple quotation marks (\") can separate instructions from additional information. For complex prompts, XML tags (e.g., <instructions>, <examples>) are recommended. XML tags allow clear labeling and structuring of sections, ensuring the AI processes each part correctly. Examples include separating hook drafts, constraints, and hook types in a copywriting prompt."
    },
    {
        "title": "Examples of Delimiter Use Cases",
        "content": "Delimiters are useful for separating distinct sections like instructions, background information, constraints, examples, audience, format, and tone. They ensure the AI treats each section independently, reducing confusion and improving output quality. XML tags are particularly effective for organizing complex prompts with multiple components."
